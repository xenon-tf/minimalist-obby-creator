# Minimalist Obby Creator
So I made an obby creator.
## Why?
Funny story actually.
While on a Discord call with Xtrau505, he made a huge obby with two full courses that must both be completed to win. I was the first to beat the obby (does that make me the verifier?), but I was desperate to see him struggle, 
so I made him a deal: If he could complete his own obby, I would create an entire obby creator in Roblox Studio.

He beat his entire obby **in only two attempts.**

I know it sounds quite dumb when I repeat this sentence out loud, but I followed through. This obby creator is a product of that.
## Are you insane?

## Why are you open-sourcing this?
Why not?
## What are the terms for using your work?
Do whatever the fuck you want to.
## Where do I find the project?
Go to releases. I'm not putting it here.
